

First of all, thank you for this opportunity. My name is Shubham Mondhoriya and I am currently working as 
a Java developer at E-bio Tech Indian Private Ltd. I have 1.5 years of experience in Java development,
during which I have worked with various technologies such as Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Java, and MySQL

I am currently working on a project called "Intact" in the insurance domain for our client,
 Ethias, from Europe. Our technology stack includes HTML and CSS for the front-end and Core 
Java, Spring MVC, Hibernate, and MySQL for the back-end. To maintain our codebase, we use GitHub,
 and all our applications are Maven-based.
"I am a Java developer on a team of 10 developers responsible for both front-end and
 back-end development. My primary responsibilities include creating various pojo classes,
 implementing RESTful web services, working on CRUD operations, handling exceptions, 
 and writing MySQL queries such as joins. In addition, I collaborate with the testing 
 team to ensure a smooth delivery process."
