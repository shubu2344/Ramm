I am currently working on a project called "Intact" in the insurance domain for our client, Ethias, from Europe. 
Our technology stack includes HTML and CSS for the front-end and Core Java, Spring MVC, Hibernate, and MySQL for
 the back-end. To maintain our codebase, we use GitHub, and all our applications are Maven-based.

Our team consists of 10 developers who are responsible for both front-end and back-end development. As a Java 
developer on the team, my primary responsibilities include creating various classes and producing RESTful web
services. We perform manual testing and fix bugs as needed and manage user requirements while providing timely 
project updates. Additionally, I coordinate with the testing team to ensure a smooth delivery process.

Tell me flow of your project ?
Fristly user send the request At user interfece then it will navigate rest controller
or web services after that moove to service layer then navigate dao layer then comes to database

Firstly, the user sends a request at the user interface. Then it navigates to the REST controller
 or web services, which then moves to the service layer. After that, it navigates to the DAO layer
 and finally reaches the database

User sends a request to the web server through the user interface
The request is handled by a REST controller or web service
The controller or service interacts with the service layer
The service layer interacts with the DAO layer
The DAO layer interacts with the database
