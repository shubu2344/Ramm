I am currently working on a project called "Intact" in the insurance domain for our client,
 Ethias, from Europe. Our technology stack includes HTML and CSS for the front-end and Core 
Java, Spring MVC, Hibernate, and MySQL forthe back-end. To maintain our codebase, we use GitHub,
 and all our applications are Maven-based.

"I am a Java developer on a team of 10 developers responsible for both front-end and
 back-end development. My primary responsibilities include creating various classes,
 implementing RESTful web services, working on CRUD operations, handling exceptions, 
 and writing MySQL queries such as joins. In addition, I collaborate with the testing 
 team to ensure a smooth delivery process."

================================================
Creating various pojo classes: In Java, classes are the building blocks of applications. As a 
Java developer, I create classes that define the behavior and attributes of objects in the 
application. These classes may include entities, data access objects, or service classes.

Implementing RESTful web services: RESTful web services are a popular way to create APIs for 
modern web applications. As a Java developer, I use the Spring framework to implement RESTful 
web services, which enables clients to interact with the server using standard HTTP requests.

Working on CRUD operations: CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the
 basic operations used in database management systems. As a Java developer, I work on the 
implementation of CRUD operations for the application's database using Spring Data or other
 related frameworks.

Handling exceptions: Exception handling is an important part of developing robust applications. 
As a Java developer, I ensure that the application handles exceptions gracefully and provides 
appropriate error messages to users.

Writing MySQL queries such as joins: MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management 
system. As a Java developer, I write SQL queries to interact with the database, including complex 
queries such as joins.

Collaborating with the testing team: As a Java developer, I work closely with the testing team to 
ensure that the application meets the requirements and quality standards. This includes reviewing
 test cases, fixing bugs, and performing integration testing.
